The report predicts the outcome of the 2020 American federal election. We used a logistic regression model to analyze the Nationscape data set. The model 
includes 7 big categorical variables. Additionally, we use backward and forward selection to find the potential combinations of variables that make the model
has the lowest AIC. We also create a post- stratification data set with 6 variables selected from American Community Survey data. We create cells based on 
different ages. Furthermore, the report includes tables of summary of our model and results. The report provides an analysis of the regression model with 
post-stratification to predict the election outcome. From a detailed examination, the estimated proportion of voters in favor of voting for Donald Trump is
